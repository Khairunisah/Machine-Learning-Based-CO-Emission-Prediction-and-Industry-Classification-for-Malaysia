# Machine-Learning-Based-CO-Emission-Prediction-and-Industry-Classification-for-Malaysia
This project aims to address that gap by developing a machine learning-based system to predict Malaysia’s future CO₂ emissions using ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models and classify industries into High, Medium, and Low emission levels using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN).
